  Everything you need to get started with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a Python framework for web development, on Platform.sh.

{{% description %}}

Anything included in these guides applies to not only to Django, but also [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/), the content management system built with Django. 

See an example Django project in the official [Platform.sh Django template](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4).
It isn't ready for production, but you can use it as a starting point for your own project.

If you already have a Django project ready to deploy,
see the template's [example Platform.sh files](https://github.com/platformsh-templates/django4/tree/master/.platform).
These files let you [configure your app](../../create-apps/_index.md),
[add services](../../add-services/_index.md), and [define routes](../../define-routes/_index.md).
