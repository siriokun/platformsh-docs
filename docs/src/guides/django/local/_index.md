    Sync Platform.sh with your local environments to start contributing.

Like any other deployment target, a significant amount of work developing Django will take place locally rather than on an active Platform.sh environment.
Below are a number of examples meant to help you:

- Create a local development environment for a Django application.
- Sync data from the active environment on Platform.sh where team review will take place.
- Commit aspects of that local development method to the project, so collaborators can replicated and contribute more easily.

All of these examples make certain assumptions about the Django application and it's service configuration, which are addressed in each section.
