    Sync Platform.sh with your local environments to start contributing.

Like any other deployment target, a significant amount of work developing Django takes place locally rather than on an active Platform.sh environment.
Each of these examples:

- Create a local development environment for a Django application.
- Sync data from the active environment on Platform.sh where team review takes place.
- Commit aspects of that local development method to the project, so collaborators can replicate configuration to contribute.

All of these examples make certain assumptions about the Django application and it's service configuration, which are addressed in each section.
