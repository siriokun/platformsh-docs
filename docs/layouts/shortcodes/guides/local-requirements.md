## Before you begin

You need:

- A local copy of the project repository on your computer.
  
  You can get one by running the following command: `platform get PROJECT_ID`.
  Or clone an integrated source repository
  and set the remote branch by running the following command: `platform project:set-remote PROJECT_ID`.
- The [Platform.sh CLI](/administration/cli/_index.md).
